            Chrono.GG was a popular online video game store ran from 2015 to late 2020.
            The site aimed to defy convention by instead of having a cluttered store with everything where individual games would easily get lost and never seen,
            instead it would work with indie developers and influencers offer just one game day at a huge discount while marketing it though a huge number of youtubers and live streamers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This light-weight desktop gadget spotlights the daily game so that you won't miss out on the great deals.
