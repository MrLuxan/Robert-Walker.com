            Chrono.GG was a popular online video game store that ran from 2015 to late 2020.
            The site aimed to defy convention by instead of having a cluttered store where individual games get easily lost and never seen,
            The team at Chrono.gg worked with indie developers and influencers to offer just one game day at a huge discount while 
            simultaneously marketing it through a huge network of YouTubers and live streamers.
