            The site makes it easy to track the progress of the different in-game collections such as achievements, reputations, mounts and pets.
            Due to the limitations of the Blizzard API it isn't possible to track a player's toy collection so Simple Armory wasn't able to included on them site.
            This Chrome extension solved this issue by adding an extra Toys page and allowed users to manually track what they had collected.         
          </p>
          <p>
            Updates on this extension stopped once simplearmory implemented its own way of tracking toy data with an in game addon.
